INFO: [Project 1-236] Implementation specific constraints were found while reading constraint file [/media/Second/workspace/Research/ring_test/zedboard_master_XDC_RevC_D_v3.xdc]. These constraints will be ignored for synthesis but will be used in implementation. Impacted constraints are listed in the file [.Xil/bench_propImpl.xdc].
Resolution: To avoid this warning, move constraints listed in [.Xil/bench_propImpl.xdc] to another XDC file and exclude this new file from synthesis with the used_in_synthesis property (File Properties dialog in GUI) and re-run elaboration/synthesis.

Resolution: This message can indicate that there are no constraints for the design, or it can indicate that the used_in flags are set such that the constraints are ignored.
