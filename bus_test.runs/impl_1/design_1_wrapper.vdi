WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net design_1_i/top_0/inst/AxiSupporter1/FSM_sequential_state_reg[1]_1 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin design_1_i/top_0/inst/AxiSupporter1/state_reg_i_2/O, cell design_1_i/top_0/inst/AxiSupporter1/state_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
